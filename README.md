# Link Share (Power App)

Link Share is a Power App made specifically for Dataverse for Microsoft Teams. It is free to use with any Microsoft Teams licence without any additional Power Apps licencing required. The concept of the app is simple, share your important and relevant web links with your team in one place that is easy to access and use. This saves you from posting within the Team chat directly and having the message disappear into the post history over time. Each user can share, vote and bookmark links that have been posted. 

Below is the main Link Share interface:

</p>

Each link has information about who posted the link, a thumbs up button for up-voting the link, a vote counter for the number of up-votes, a bookmark option and a link button for opening the link in a browser window. The filter combo box allows you to see links from that day, week, month or forever. The sort combo box allows you to order the links by votes or post date.

In the Filter combo there is an option to show the Top Contributors which is ordered by votes. The top 3 contributors get gold, silver and bronze medal highlights around their photo so you know theyâ€™re awesome. The medals are also shown back on the main screen behind the user photo.

If you select Bookmarks from the filter combo box you will see all of the links that you have bookmarked on the main page.
